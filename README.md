# dontForgetMe
This is a school project to show Jade (Java multi-agent platform)
capabilities. It simulates the detection process of a baby forgotten
on a car and it sends a message to inform the situation.

## Usage
Download the [Jade library](http://jade.tilab.com/) and make sure to add it to
your Java classpath.

You can import the project to Intellij Idea, add the Jade
dependence and run it.

##### Or
Compile all the Java classes contained on the project.

Also make sure to have Jade library on your Java classpath.

Run the main class `Main.class`

Every time you run the project you will see on the sniffer one
of the three simulation cases choosen randomly.
